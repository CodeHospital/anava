        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: May 2, 2025</p>

        <p>CodeHospital GmbH ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you use our Anava spiritual recording application (the "App") and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>

        <h3>1. Important Information and Who We Are</h3>

        <p>This privacy policy aims to give you information on how we collect and process your personal data through your use of the App, including any data you may provide when you record spiritual practices, create an account, or use any features within the App.</p>

        <p>The App is designed with respect for the sacred nature of all spiritual practices, whether they are part of organized religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, or more personal spiritual paths such as connecting with the universe or following karma-based principles. We understand the deeply personal nature of your spiritual expressions and have designed our privacy measures accordingly.</p>

        <p>CodeHospital GmbH is the controller and responsible for your personal data.</p>

        <h3>2. The Data We Collect About You</h3>

        <p>We may collect, use, store, and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, last name, username, or similar identifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes email address and optional phone number.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes device type, operating system, and app version.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> includes information about how you use our App, such as frequency of use and features accessed.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Recordings</strong> includes the spiritual recordings you create using the App, which may contain personal expressions specific to your belief system, whether religious prayers, universal intentions, or karmic reflections.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences</strong> includes settings such as practice reminder times, which may reflect specific observances like Salat times, Shabbat, meditation sessions, celestial alignments, or karmic reflection periods.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race, ethnicity, political opinions, philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, information about your health, genetic and biometric data). While we recognize that spiritual recordings may inherently reveal your beliefs, we treat this content with the utmost respect and privacy.</p>

        <h3>3. How We Collect Your Personal Data</h3>

        <p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct interactions.</strong> You may give us your Identity and Contact Data by creating an account or contacting our support team.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated technologies or interactions.</strong> As you interact with our App, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your device and Usage Data about how you use the App. We collect this data using cookies and other similar technologies.</li>
            <li><strong>User-generated content.</strong> When you record spiritual practices or devotions using our App, this content is stored on your device and, if you choose to enable backup features, may be stored in your personal cloud storage accounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. How We Use Your Personal Data</h3>

        <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
            <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
            <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We have set out below a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To register you as a new user</li>
            <li>To provide and maintain the App's functionality</li>
            <li>To manage your relationship with us</li>
            <li>To improve our App and user experience</li>
            <li>To provide customer support</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our terms or privacy policy</li>
            <li>To administer and protect our business and the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Storage and Security of Your Spiritual Recordings</h3>

        <p>We understand that your recordings are deeply personal expressions of your spiritual path, whether you're reciting religious prayers, speaking to the universe, or reflecting on karmic principles. We have implemented the following measures to ensure their privacy and security:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> By default, all spiritual recordings are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Backup:</strong> If you choose to use the backup feature, your recordings will be stored in your personal cloud storage account (such as Google Drive or iCloud) and not on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All recordings are encrypted on your device using industry-standard encryption protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> We do not have access to your spiritual recordings unless you explicitly share them with us (for example, when seeking technical support).</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your recordings at any time from within the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Data Sharing and Transfers</h3>

        <p>We treat your personal data, especially your spiritual recordings, with the utmost respect and confidentiality. We do not sell your data to third parties. We may share your personal data with the following categories of recipients:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your data with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting providers and analytics services. These providers are bound by contractual obligations to keep your personal data confidential and secure.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless adequate protection measures are in place.</p>

        <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>

        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

        <p>Your spiritual recordings and related data are stored on your device and will remain there until you choose to delete them. If you use our backup feature, the retention of your data in your personal cloud storage account is subject to the policies of your cloud storage provider.</p>

        <p>If you delete the App from your device without first backing up your data, your spiritual recordings and other locally stored data will be permanently deleted.</p>

        <h3>8. Your Legal Rights</h3>

        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including the right to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data</li>
            <li>Request correction of your personal data</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal data</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data</li>
            <li>Request transfer of your personal data</li>
